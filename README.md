# Information
Crolus bot is an expandable (modular) Discord Bot created for [Discord Hack Week](https://blog.discordapp.com/discord-community-hack-week-build-and-create-alongside-us-6b2a7b7bba33?gi=3b42d82a0608). It is user friendly, fully customizable, and includes a developer's API.

The Crolus project takes an innovative approach to the Discord API. By implementing a modular interface, it opens a new door to Discord communities and developers. Users can now create and share modules within their communities, implementing them with a single command. Developers can setup dozens of new commands and features in half the required time, thanks to our advanced command processing package and plugin interface. Events are handled concurrently and efficiently, with clean and organized command mappings. An object oriented approach allows for cleaner event handling and data management.

Our user friendly web-app allows the average user to customize the bot without any prior knowledge of computer programming. The simple and organized nature of the web-panel makes it easy to use efficiently.
